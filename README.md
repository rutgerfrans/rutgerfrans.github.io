# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About me
<p style="text-align: justify;"> I am a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence student at Maastricht University, passionate about programming and software engineering. My academic journey has equipped me with skills in software development, data analysis, and AI applications. I thrive on solving complex problems and building innovative solutions with real-world impact. Currently, I work as a freelance Machine Learning Engineer, developing and optimizing NLP models for sentiment analysis of financial news, and enhancing real-time market-driven applications. </p>

# üìÇ Projects
## Steel surface shotblasting quality control with computer vision
<p style="text-align: justify;"> From September 2024 to January 2025, I worked on an automated quality control system for shot-blasted steel surfaces using computer vision. We developed SteelBlastQC, a dataset of 1,655 labeled images, and evaluated classification methods including Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCT), Support Vector Machines (SVM) with ResNet-50, and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). My focus was optimizing the SVM pipeline, improving classification accuracy to 94.5%, and developing interpretability methods. Using an Agile workflow, we iteratively refined the model, with future work aimed at improving dataset quality and real-world deployment. This project resulted in a publishment of a paper for the <a href="[https://openai.com](https://2025.ijcnn.org/)" target="_blank">IJCNN 2025</a> Conference. </p>

## LLM-Based Financial News Analysis
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Since June 2024, I have been collaborating with two partners, under the guidance of an experienced entrepreneur-investor, to develop a Large Language Model (LLM) for financial news analysis. The goal is to integrate sentiment from news articles into trading strategies. The project includes a custom-trained LLM on financial data, real-time sentiment classification, a backtesting framework, and a React-Django platform for monitoring. A major challenge was ensuring high-quality sentiment labeling, which we addressed through a continuous feedback loop between model predictions, backtesting, and relabeling. Following an Agile approach with Scrum principles, we iteratively refined the model. Moving forward, we aim to enhance adaptability to market conditions and further integrate AI-driven insights into trading strategies. </p>

## Microservices with GraphQL
<p style="text-align: justify;"> During my Applied Sciences graduation internship at Ivengi, I conducted literature research on software architectures, REST APIs, and query languages. Additionally, I designed and implemented a software architecture incorporating a gateway pattern with GraphQL. This solution improved data retrieval efficiency and reduced complexity within the monolithic architecture, enhancing overall system maintainability. </p>

## Statemachine code generator
<p style="text-align: justify;"> During my Applied Sciences graduation internship at Ivengi, I conducted literature research on software architectures, REST APIs, and query languages. As part of my work, I designed and implemented a software architecture featuring a gateway pattern with GraphQL. This approach optimized data fetching, reducing complexity within the monolithic architecture while enhancing efficiency and maintainability. </p>

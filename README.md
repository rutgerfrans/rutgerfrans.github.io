# üìÇ Projects
## LLM-Based Financial News Analysis
Since June 2024, I have been collaborating with two partners, under the guidance of an experienced entrepreneur-investor, to develop a Large Language Model (LLM) for financial news analysis. The goal is to integrate sentiment from news articles into trading strategies. The project includes a custom-trained LLM on financial data, real-time sentiment classification, a backtesting framework, and a React-Django platform for monitoring. A major challenge was ensuring high-quality sentiment labeling, which we addressed through a continuous feedback loop between model predictions, backtesting, and relabeling. Following an Agile approach with Scrum principles, we iteratively refined the model. Moving forward, we aim to enhance adaptability to market conditions and further integrate AI-driven insights into trading strategies.

## Microservices with GraphQL
During my Applied Sciences graduation internship at Ivengi, I conducted literature research on software architectures, REST APIs, and query languages. Additionally, I designed and implemented a software architecture incorporating a gateway pattern with GraphQL. This solution improved data retrieval efficiency and reduced complexity within the monolithic architecture, enhancing overall system maintainability.

## Statemachine code generator
During my Applied Sciences graduation internship at Ivengi, I conducted literature research on software architectures, REST APIs, and query languages. As part of my work, I designed and implemented a software architecture featuring a gateway pattern with GraphQL. This approach optimized data fetching, reducing complexity within the monolithic architecture while enhancing efficiency and maintainability.

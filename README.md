## BSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 

### About me
I am a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence student at Maastricht University, passionate about programming and software engineering. My academic journey has equipped me with skills in software development, data analysis, and AI applications. I thrive on solving complex problems and building innovative solutions with real-world impact. Currently, I work as a freelance Machine Learning Engineer, developing and optimizing NLP models for sentiment analysis of financial news, and enhancing real-time market-driven applications.

### Projects
#### LLM

#### Microservices with GraphQL
During my Applied Sciences graduation internship at Ivengi, I conducted literature research on software architectures, REST APIs, and query languages. Additionally, I designed and implemented a software architecture incorporating a gateway pattern with GraphQL. This solution improved data retrieval efficiency and reduced complexity within the monolithic architecture, enhancing overall system maintainability.

#### Statemachine code generator
During my Applied Sciences graduation internship at Ivengi, I conducted literature research on software architectures, REST APIs, and query languages. As part of my work, I designed and implemented a software architecture featuring a gateway pattern with GraphQL. This approach optimized data fetching, reducing complexity within the monolithic architecture while enhancing efficiency and maintainability.

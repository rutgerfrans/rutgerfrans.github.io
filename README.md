### About me
I am a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence student at Maastricht University, passionate about programming and software engineering. My academic journey has equipped me with skills in software development, data analysis, and AI applications. I thrive on solving complex problems and building innovative solutions with real-world impact. Currently, I work as a freelance Machine Learning Engineer, developing and optimizing NLP models for sentiment analysis of financial news, and enhancing real-time market-driven applications.

### Projects
#### LLM-Based Financial News Analysis
Since June 2024, I have been collaborating with two partners, under the guidance of an experienced entrepreneur-investor, to develop a Large Language Model (LLM) for financial news analysis. The goal is to integrate sentiment from news articles into trading strategies. The project includes a custom-trained LLM on financial data, real-time sentiment classification, a backtesting framework, and a React-Django platform for monitoring. A major challenge was ensuring high-quality sentiment labeling, which we addressed through a continuous feedback loop between model predictions, backtesting, and relabeling. Following an Agile approach with Scrum principles, we iteratively refined the model. Moving forward, we aim to enhance adaptability to market conditions and further integrate AI-driven insights into trading strategies.

#### Microservices with GraphQL
During my Applied Sciences graduation internship at Ivengi, I conducted literature research on software architectures, REST APIs, and query languages. Additionally, I designed and implemented a software architecture incorporating a gateway pattern with GraphQL. This solution improved data retrieval efficiency and reduced complexity within the monolithic architecture, enhancing overall system maintainability.

#### Statemachine code generator
During my Applied Sciences graduation internship at Ivengi, I conducted literature research on software architectures, REST APIs, and query languages. As part of my work, I designed and implemented a software architecture featuring a gateway pattern with GraphQL. This approach optimized data fetching, reducing complexity within the monolithic architecture while enhancing efficiency and maintainability.

### Skills
#### Hardskills
##### Software Engineering
In front-end development, I have gained experience in programming with WordPress, JavaScript, React and HTML to build responsive and user-friendly websites. On the back-end, I have worked with Node.js, TypeScript, and Django, developing scalable applications using REST APIs, GraphQL, and gateway architectures. Additionally, I have experience with Ubuntu LTS environments and designing robust software architectures for efficient system performance.

##### Datascience & Artificial Intelligence
I have experience in applying recursive programming with Python and C# to solve problems like sorting and language recognition. My skills include preparing datasets for machine learning models and making predictions using advanced algorithms. I have worked with NLP models like RoBERTa for sentiment analysis of financial news and continue to expand my knowledge in deep learning, distributed AI systems, and model deployment.

#### Softskills
I'm adept at troubleshooting and creative problem-solving. I thrive in group projects, valuing 
teamwork and collaboration. I'm proactive and dedicated, with a strong work ethic, which 
means I see tasks through to completion. My persistence and creativity round out my skill set. 
I am comfortable in social environments, friendly and easy talker.
